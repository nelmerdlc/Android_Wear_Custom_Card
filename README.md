# Android Wear Custom Card

This is a demonstration on how to create a custom card to display content on Android Wear devices.

The result is a card displaying example information about a flight, but since the this is using a Fragment and a LinearLayout you can design a layout as custom as you need, just like any simple android app.

Enjoy :)
